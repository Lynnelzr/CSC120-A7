Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the constructors in every subclasses and the moveIn() method in House class because student's name and ID can all be included in the information collection; and addTitle() method in the Library class because we can also include the publication date about his book while recording it's information.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think we need to figure out what kinds of information are logic to be included in the overload methods. Also, don't forget about the arrylist we created for the specific subclass in the overloaded constructors.
